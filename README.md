## 1. Inventory Management:
        As a shop owner, I want to manage my inventory efficiently by adding, updating, and deleting products so that I can keep track of available stock, avoid overstocking, and be notified when stock is low.
        As a shop owner, I want to categorise products based on their type (e.g., farm products, packaged goods) to differentiate between different product lines and get insights into their performance.
        If a product is purchased: increase the quantity and all details in the inventory,
        If a product is sold, make sure to reduce the product in inventory.
## 2. Sales Tracking:
        As a shop owner, I want to record each sale with details of the products sold, quantity, date, and customer information so that I can accurately track daily sales and calculate profits or losses. The customer information is only required if the customer is buying products via the app or they are buying on credit, otherwise, persons buying directly from the shop/retail and pay with cash, their information is not required.
        As a shop owner, I want to distinguish between cash sales, mpesa sales, credit sales to better manage finances and ensure accurate accounting.
        Make sure the product is available in the inventory before making sale
        Record sale payment
## 3. Credit sales:
        the buyer should agree to the terms of services { include payment means: cash, mpesa }
        If the buyer's option is cash, they should enter token provided on cash payment,
        if the buyer pays using mpesa, confirm payment and provide balance or refund if any.
        if the credit goes beyond payday, cancel all services to customers (including cash) until debt is paid.

## 4. Payment Processing:
        As a shop owner, I want to process payments via cash or mobile money, customers have flexible payment options and I can track outstanding balances.
        Customer Management:
        As a shop owner, I want to manage customer details and credit sales so that I can track which customers owe money and send reminders for payment.
        If the product is to be delivered, be able to get to their location with ease.
## 5. Notifications:
        As a shop owner, I want to receive notifications for low stock, overdue payments, and top-up reminders for credit customers so that I can take timely action to maintain stock levels and manage receivables.
        I also want to receive notification in case of updates required and if there are any issues
## 6. Purchases:
        I want to be able to record purchases made for a particular product.
        If the product is new, add it to the inventory
        Record the purchase payment
